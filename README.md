## Overview

This database project simulates a preschool management system that tracks students, parents, classrooms, and teachers. Built using **ER modeling and SQL scripting in MySQL Workbench**, the project involves designing, creating, populating, and querying a fully normalized relational database.

The database was designed from scratch based on a personalized ERD specification and adheres to naming conventions, relationship modeling, and integrity constraints. The purpose is to support detailed reporting of class groupings, parent-student-teacher relationships, and enrollment data.
